## Some things about my project

- I developed an immersive and interactive user interface using front-end technologies that provide an authentic gaming experience with a fully functional keyboard.

- I was able to implement a backend that retrieves questions on over 700 programming languages.

- My program also utilizes parent and child components to render game visuals and facilitate the exchange of shared states between components, enhancing code maintainability and reusability.
